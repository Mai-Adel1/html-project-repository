<h3>Applications of Mobile Computing:</h3>
<p>•	The real power of mobile computing becomes
apparent when mobile hardware, Software, and
communications are optimally configured and
used to accomplish a Specified mobile task.
Although many varied applications exist, mobile
computing applications can generally be divided
into two categories--horizontal and vertica</p>
<p>-	Horizontal:
Horizontal applications have broad-based appeal
and include software that performs functions such
as: (a) email; (b) Web browsing; (c) word
processing; (d) scheduling; (e) contact
management; (f) to-do lists; (g) messaging; (h)
presentation. These types of applications usually
come standard on Palmtops, Clamshells, and
laptops with systems software such as Windows
95. </p>
<p>-	Vertical:
Vertical applications are industry-specific and only
have appeal within the specific Industry for which
the application was written. Vertical applications
are commonly used in industries such as: (a)
retailing; (b) utilities; (c) warehousing; (d)
shipping; (e) Medical and (f) law enforcement and
public safety. These vertical applications are often
transaction oriented and normally interface with a
corporate database. Other application areas
include: (a) mining; (b) forestry; (c)agriculture; and
(d) surveying etc.</p>
<p>•	Some of the major field in which mobile computing can be applied are:</p>
<p>	Web or Internet access-Global Position System(GPS)-Emergency services-Entertainment services-Educational services.</p>
